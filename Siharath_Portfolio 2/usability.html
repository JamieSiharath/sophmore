<h2>Method</h2> <p><i><b>What website did you study? Who is the target audience? What three tasks did you assign to your subjects?</i></b> <br> The website we studied were our portfolio. Our target audience are high school students. The three tasks I assigned were:
				<li>Click on "Javascript" in the navigation bar. Click on the "Show clock"/"Hide clock" button multiple times. Does it work? *</a>
					</li>
				<li>Scroll down on the "Javascript" page and type into "Other" of the checkout section. Does your text show up?
					</li>
				<li>Click on "Home" in the navigation bar. Click on "Skip to Main Content" in the upper left corner. Does it bring you to the Unit paragraphs?</a>
					</li></p>

<h2>Results</h2> <p><i><b>Were subjects able to complete the tasks you assigned them? Was it easy for them? How much time, or how many steps, did it take to complete the tasks?</i></b> <br> The subjects were able to complete all the tasks assigned to them. It was easy for them, and it took them 2-5 minutes to complete all the tasks. 

<h2>Discussion</h2> <p><i><b>What did you learn from this study about the website? Is the current design effective? Why or why not? How might the site be designed differently so that users could more easily perform the representative tasks?</i></b> <br> I learned that certain things may appear easy to do on my website when I'm using it, but difficult for others. My current design is effective, because it's easy to navigate and use. Other things I could do to fix my website is to go through all the minor errors in my website.</p>
